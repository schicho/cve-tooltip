# CVE Tooltip

Ever wanted to quickly check the details of a CVE without having to copy and paste it into a search engine?

This browser extension finds references to CVEs in web pages and adds a small icon next to them.
Hovering over the icon will display a tooltip with the CVE details, which are fetched from the MITRE API.
It also provides a link directly to the NVD CVE details page.

On phones, the tooltip is displayed when the CVE is tapped.
